## Questions
As you pointed out last week I have a ankle mobility issue. I have been working on it for months (if not a year)
with some but limited success.
* Should I postpone running the Beginning Weight Lifting Program while I try to fix the ankle issue?
* What is the most time efficient way of addressing mobility issues?
  1. Is it important to stretch every day or only on days when I workout?
  2. Should I stretch before or after the workout? Or both?
  3. Should I favor stretching frequency over longer sessions? (I have sometimes stretch for close to an hour but
  I can't to that every day)
  4. Can you recommend any resources/stretches/programs?

* BWL W1D4 Forus:
  * Active lats, wrists, pulling the bar towards me.
  * Go slower (surprisingly hard), go through the position
  * Aggressive foot movement in the PC
  * Don't go passed the heal with the front knee in the jerk
  * [Snatch + Snatch balance](https://youtu.be/rZjNZnkdWUQ?t=19)

### Answer notes
* I start at 3:37
* On the Snatch:
  1. Too aggressive, go through the positions, more control
  1. More upright torso in the catch, **ankle mobility**
* C&J
  1. In the first pull the bar is *out and away*. It is important that the bar goes *up an into us*. **Up And Back**
  1. More aggressive foot movement. *Lift the feet and drive aggressively into the floor*.
  1. The split is too low, too deep. *For knee too much forward, back leg too bent*. *Front knee should **never be come
over the heel** of the front foot*

Last week you told me I was cutting my 2nd pull too short, not sure if I was able to improve it:

* [Snatch W1D2](https://youtu.be/Iy2mcJ4fAuo?t=12)
* [C&J W1D2](https://youtu.be/HLdpf2Q9MfE?t=21)

PS: I sent you guys an e-mail, to sikastrength@gmail.com, last week about my BWL program because the 1RMs
were incorrectly set but I haven't gotten any response?

* I start at 14:48
* Snatch:
  1. Bringing my hips in too son and overextending them. Cutting the 2nd pull short.
  2. Keep the 2nd pool as long as possible.
  3. Stay over (the bar) with the holders.
  3. Knees should stay back
  4. Hips should say back
  2. Drive with the legs
  3. Extend straight up

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58eDfxaaLao) is how I typically fail stanches when I'm getting close to my 1RM:

For some reason, the bar tends to be in front of me when I catch it. What is going in?

[Same weight, same session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DmNXgzTsko) I was way happier with this one.
I have been looking at both those lifts in slow-mo trying to figure out what goes wrong in the first one but I don't really see any difference. 

Bonus Q:
I'm planning on starting the "Beginner Weightlifting Program" next week. I can still power snatch more than I can squat snatch, should I still use my squat snatch 1RM when purchasing the program?

PS: Calling me Paul is fine, you are never going to be able to pronounce Páll correctly anyway :D

Used to powerlifting style, wide stance low bar squats. Trying to modify them to weightlifting style high bar style:

[Back squat](https://youtu.be/chJYyIczL9A?t=30)

Feel like I'm still leaning too much forward. Should I keep the bar higher on the back?
