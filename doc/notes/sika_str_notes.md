* BWL W7D3. 
Had an off day. Failed the two heavier PC&J. I Failed the PC, but this was weight that I have easily PC before.
Not sure what was going on, probably a combination of sleep issues and bad nutrition. 
Unless you say otherwise I plan just to ignore this setback and continue with the program as normal?
* BWL W7D4 C&J 3x1
Last week, you told me to straighten my back during the dynamic start before the pull. Was trying to get rid of this early elbow bend. I really thought had nailed it when doing the lift but I can still clearly see it on the video.
The toes are still moving to the sides at the end of the dynamic start, need to focus more on that.
* BWL W8D1
Snatch Highpull + High Hang Snatch 2x(1+1)
Last week you told me to focus on pulling with my back when in the extension and get my elbows high

* [My questions](https://www.facebook.com/groups/323490962344244/posts/1123631138996885/?comment_id=1123762735650392&__cft__[0]=AZWXW_fwzwmEStVHZZ5G_-aUw7UVJDGZ6d5Vt9wAj96LsAd218X2VS-Iyyxs5S9r8S1gHDGMqsARmoXQwCuL4JY3DFzedBMVCPhbm4EzlKhfpcHD_GiKrRWeBgzODsCG4V9T-1onBsLov6_aFwQj-k1jP_4M3bLrIebvWAV0UXPUOH4r8obewbDQAe2zlJu9jSE&__tn__=R]-R)
* I'm taking your advice from your 16 tips video and starting to do cardio after my WL sessions. I will start by spending 20 min on C2 bike twice this week and plan to build that up to 30 min almost every day. Now my question is, should I have a plan on how to ramp this up, or should I just go by feel? How long should this ramp-up take?
  * Consider using the cardio program when it becomes available on the app
* I have started to play around a bit with dynamic start BWL W6D2 Snatch 5x1
  * Focus on flattening out the back when going down in the dynamic start
  * Focus on pulling with the back after the second pull in the extension. Elbows high.
  * Pull the feet up from the floor.
* BWL W6D4 C&J 3x2
  * Set the tow angle so that they don't move when going down in the dynamic start
  * Don't bend the elbows to get the bar into my hip
* BWL W7D1 FS Proceed to maximum = 150kg. My FS has always lagged way behind my BS due to lat and ankle mobility issues. This either is or is very close to my all-time FS PB. Don't feel like mobility is a hindrance in the FS any more.
  * Work on ankle mobility

### Questions
* BWL. W6D4. [Back squats 6x4](https://www.facebook.com/groups/323490962344244/posts/939957527364248/?comment_id=940324147327586). This is the last set. Been a while since I have gone this heavy. The first set felt like
shit but then they progressively got better.
* [W6D3. Power snatch. 3x2.](https://www.facebook.com/groups/323490962344244/posts/939957527364248/?comment_id=940324147327586&reply_comment_id=940332417326759)
* Last week you told me to focus on a having a long 2nd pull. I'm not entirely sure what is meant my that. Does that 
mean getting my torso closer to horizontal, but still keeping my shoulders over the bar and my knees bent?
* W7D2. Today's snatch training was complete shit. Was supposed to do 5x1 88kg. While building up to that I failed at
87.5kg so I when back down for a few more warmups before I started to go up again.
How does this change the program going forward? [Here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/323490962344244/posts/939957527364248/?comment_id=940324147327586&reply_comment_id=940340500659284) is me failing at 80kg.
* W7D2 [Clean Pull + Clean + Jerk](https://www.facebook.com/groups/323490962344244/posts/939957527364248/?comment_id=940324147327586&reply_comment_id=940344307325570). In the clean I was trying to focus on pulling my self under the bar (as instructed last week) instead of focusing on the extension

* BWL W3D2
* [Snatch:](https://youtu.be/0KYQFJKtwEs?t=20)
  * Focusing on shoulders in front of the bar.
  * Changed the start position so it is now a bit higher. Is it maybe to high now, looks like my lower back is a bit rounded at the beginning of the pull.
* [C&J:](https://youtu.be/kXy4gH8skaY?t=23) Focusing on keeping the foot in front of the knee in the jerk
* [Clean DL:](https://youtu.be/atZGUmXazy8?t=24) Don't think I have done these before I started the program.

### Answer notes
* I Start at 26:25
* 4-6 months of working on ankle mobility. 20m a day after the gym or in the evening
  * Checkout out Squat University and/or Mobility Wod
* Snatch:
  * Film from the side.
  * Make sure the shoulders over or in advance of the bar
  * Change the starting position by racing the hips by 2-3 inches
  * Keep going slow for the 1st pull but explode in the 2nd pull (from the knees)
* Snatch balance/Jerk:
  * Don't pause after the dip. Dip and drive should be smooth motion
  * Don't check the feet position after the jerk. Just recover and finish the lift. Check the video after.

As you pointed out last week I have a ankle mobility issue. I have been working on it for months (if not a year)
with some but limited success.
* Should I postpone running the Beginning Weight Lifting Program while I try to fix the ankle issue?
* What is the most time efficient way of addressing mobility issues?
  1. Is it important to stretch every day or only on days when I workout?
  2. Should I stretch before or after the workout? Or both?
  3. Should I favor stretching frequency over longer sessions? (I have sometimes stretch for close to an hour but
  I can't to that every day)
  4. Can you recommend any resources/stretches/programs?

* BWL W1D4 Focus:
  * Active lats, wrists, pulling the bar towards me.
  * Go slower (surprisingly hard), go through the position
  * Aggressive foot movement in the PC
  * Don't go passed the heal with the front knee in the jerk
  * [Snatch + Snatch balance](https://youtu.be/rZjNZnkdWUQ?t=19)

### Answer notes
* I start at 3:37
* On the Snatch:
  1. Too aggressive, go through the positions, more control
  1. More upright torso in the catch, **ankle mobility**
* C&J
  1. In the first pull the bar is *out and away*. It is important that the bar goes *up an into us*. **Up And Back**
  1. More aggressive foot movement. *Lift the feet and drive aggressively into the floor*.
  1. The split is too low, too deep. *For knee too much forward, back leg too bent*. *Front knee should **never be come
over the heel** of the front foot*

Last week you told me I was cutting my 2nd pull too short, not sure if I was able to improve it:
* [Snatch W1D1](https://youtu.be/3UxpvsmlT8s?t=8)
* [Snatch W1D2](https://youtu.be/Iy2mcJ4fAuo?t=12)
* [C&J W1D2](https://youtu.be/HLdpf2Q9MfE?t=21)

PS: I sent you guys an e-mail, to sikastrength@gmail.com, last week about my BWL program because the 1RMs
were incorrectly set but I haven't gotten any response?

## [2022-11-25](https://www.facebook.com/groups/323490962344244/posts/886155642744437/)
* I start at 14:48
* Snatch:
  1. Bringing my hips in too son and overextending them. Cutting the 2nd pull short.
  2. Keep the 2nd pool as long as possible.
  3. Stay over (the bar) with the holders.
  3. Knees should stay back
  4. Hips should say back
  2. Drive with the legs
  3. Extend straight up

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58eDfxaaLao) is how I typically fail stanches when I'm getting close to my 1RM:

For some reason, the bar tends to be in front of me when I catch it. What is going in?

[Same weight, same session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DmNXgzTsko) I was way happier with this one.
I have been looking at both those lifts in slow-mo trying to figure out what goes wrong in the first one but I don't really see any difference. 

Bonus Q:
I'm planning on starting the "Beginner Weightlifting Program" next week. I can still power snatch more than I can squat snatch, should I still use my squat snatch 1RM when purchasing the program?

PS: Calling me Paul is fine, you are never going to be able to pronounce Páll correctly anyway :D

* I Start at 18:40
* Back squat:
  * Keep the elbows a bit further back. Almost 45° angle.

Used to powerlifting style, wide stance low bar squats. Trying to modify them to weightlifting style high bar style:

[Back squat](https://youtu.be/chJYyIczL9A?t=30)

Feel like I'm still leaning too much forward. Should I keep the bar higher on the back?
